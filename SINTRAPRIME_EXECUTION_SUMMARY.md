## Next Steps (Your Options)

### Option A: Deploy It Now (Recommended)

1. Open: `docs/SINTRAPRIME_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`
2. Execute Phase 0 → Phase 10
3. Time: ~60 minutes
4. Result: SintraPrime appears in ChatGPT, desktop, PDFs, Notion

### Option B: Review First, Deploy Later

1. Read: `brand/SINTRAPRIME_BRAND_SPEC.md` (5 min)
2. Skim: `docs/SINTRAPRIME_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` (10 min)
3. Return to Option A when ready

### Option C: Integrate With Existing Systems

**Python + PDFs:**
```python
from scripts.sintraprime_pdf_header import add_sintraprime_header
# ... use the function ...
```

**Notion Automation:**
→ Follow `templates/notion/NOTION_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`

**ChatGPT:**
→ Copy mode declaration from `docs/mode-declaration.md` into system prompt

## How It Works (60-Minute Execution)

### Phase 0: Prep (5 min)
Verify access to repo, ChatGPT Plus, design tools.

### Phase 1: Asset Generation (10 min)
Export SVG → PNG (512, 256, 128, 64, 48, 24) + Windows ICO.
Tools: Figma, Inkscape, or online converter.

### Phase 2: Repo Structure (5 min)
Create folder layout: `brand/`, `templates/`, etc.

### Phase 3: Mode Declaration Templates (5 min)
Create Notion + canonical declaration files.

### Phase 4: ChatGPT Custom GPT (10 min)
Upload icon, configure system prompt, publish.

### Phase 5: Desktop Integration (5 min)
Create shortcut, assign icon, pin to taskbar.

### Phase 6: Notion (10 min, optional)
Create database with schema, add mode declaration block.

### Phase 7: PDF Header (5 min)
Create HTML template or use ReportLab function.

### Phase 8: Git Commit (5 min)
Commit all files (they're already staged).

### Phase 9: Verification (5 min)
Test each integration point (ChatGPT, desktop, Notion, PDF).

### Phase 10: Announcement (2 min, optional)
Announce to your team.

## Why This Works

**Agent Mode feels official because:**
- Same icon everywhere (consistent visual identity)
- Same ritual every time (mode switch)
- Persistent across contexts (ChatGPT, desktop, etc.)

**SintraPrime Mode achieves the same through:**
- Locked sigil (exact geometry spec)
- Locked language (5 canonical declarations)
- Integrated everywhere (ChatGPT, desktop, PDF, Notion, CLI)

**Auditable because:**
- All files in Git
- All specs locked (dated amendments required)
- All changes tracked (commit history)

---

## What Regulators See

When auditors encounter SintraPrime Mode:

1. **Visual Signal**: Sigil (🜂) appears consistently
2. **Linguistic Signal**: Mode declaration header with governance state
3. **Audit Trail**: Git history shows all changes + rationale
4. **Operational Log**: Notion database tracks every run + metadata
5. **Reproducibility**: Run hash allows deterministic replay

**They understand instantly:** This is a governed, auditable system.

That's the point.

---

## What Users Experience

1. **Week 1**: Click SintraPrime icon in ChatGPT sidebar. Mode feels native.
2. **Week 2**: Desktop shortcut becomes muscle memory. "I click SintraPrime to think this way."
3. **Week 3**: Notion dashboard populated. Mode status visible on every run.
4. **Week 4**: PDFs arrive with sigil header. "This is official."
5. **Week 5**: Team says "SintraPrime Mode" in conversation. It's real.

## Go/No-Go Checklist (Before Deploying)

- [ ] You can create ChatGPT Custom GPTs (ChatGPT Plus)
- [ ] You have Git access (can commit)
- [ ] You can export SVG → PNG (have Figma, Inkscape, or use online converter)
- [ ] You have Notion access (if doing Phase 6)
- [ ] You have Python 3 (for ReportLab integration, if needed)

**All clear?** → Execute Phase 0 of `docs/SINTRAPRIME_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

**During Phase 1 (PNG export)?**
→ Use CloudConvert.com (free, no install)

**During Phase 4 (ChatGPT)?**
→ Wait 5 minutes after publish. Refresh. Retry.

**During Phase 5 (Desktop)?**
→ Verify ICO file exists. Try re-assigning icon.

**During Phase 8 (Git commit)?**
→ Check `git status`. Resolve conflicts. Retry.

**During Phase 9 (Verification)?**
→ Test one context at a time. Debug in isolation.

All answers in `docs/SINTRAPRIME_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` (Troubleshooting section).
