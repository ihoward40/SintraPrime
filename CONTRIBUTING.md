## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** >= 20.x
- **npm** >= 10.x
- **Git**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for full-stack testing)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button at the top of the [SintraPrime repository](https://github.com/ihoward40/SintraPrime).

2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SintraPrime.git
   cd SintraPrime
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote** to keep your fork in sync:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ihoward40/SintraPrime.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Copy the environment file and configure it:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local configuration
   ```

6. **Verify your setup** by running the build and tests:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- **Bug Reports:** Open an issue with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and expected vs. actual behavior.
- **Feature Requests:** Open an issue describing the feature, its use case, and how it aligns with SintraPrime's governance-first architecture.
- **Code Contributions:** Submit a pull request for bug fixes, new features, or improvements.
- **Documentation:** Improve existing documentation or add new guides, tutorials, and examples.
- **Testing:** Add or improve unit tests, integration tests, and smoke tests.

If you are unsure where to start, look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

## Branch Naming Conventions

All branches must follow a consistent naming convention. This ensures clarity and makes it easy to understand the purpose of each branch at a glance.

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `feat/` | New features or capabilities | `feat/add-slack-adapter` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/receipt-signature-validation` |
| `docs/` | Documentation changes | `docs/update-api-reference` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, refactoring, CI/CD | `chore/upgrade-typescript-5.8` |
| `test/` | Adding or improving tests | `test/add-workflow-runner-tests` |
| `security/` | Security patches and hardening | `security/patch-minimatch-redos` |

Always branch from the latest `master` branch:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

## Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This enables automated changelog generation and makes the commit history easy to read.

**Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `chore` | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `security` | A security-related change |
| `ci` | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts |

**Examples:**

```
feat(browser): add governed browser operator with Ajv2020 compile gate
fix(receipts): enforce receipt_id filenames for ledger consistency
docs(governance): update mode governance release notes to v1.1
chore(deps): bump express from 4.21.2 to 5.2.1
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date** with the latest `master`:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

2. **Run all checks locally** before submitting:

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request** against the `master` branch of the upstream repository.

4. **Fill out the PR template** completely, including:
   - A clear description of the changes
   - The issue number(s) being addressed (e.g., `Closes #42`)
   - A summary of testing performed
   - Any breaking changes

5. **Respond to review feedback** promptly and constructively.

6. **CI checks must pass.** All automated checks (TypeScript type checking, build verification, schema validation, and security audits) must pass before a PR can be merged.

7. **Approval required.** At least one maintainer must approve the PR before it can be merged.

8. **Branch cleanup.** After your PR is merged, delete the feature branch both locally and on your fork to keep the repository clean.

## Code Style & Standards

SintraPrime is a TypeScript-first project. All new code must be written in TypeScript.

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode). No new JavaScript files.
- **Formatting:** Use Prettier with the project's default configuration.
- **Linting:** All code must pass ESLint checks.
- **Type Safety:** Use explicit types. Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary and documented.
- **File Organization:** Follow the existing directory structure. Place adapters in `agents/`, governance logic in `governance/`, and scripts in `scripts/`.
- **Testing:** All new features and bug fixes should include corresponding tests. Use the existing test infrastructure in `tests/`.

## Governance Compliance

SintraPrime is a governance-first platform. All contributions must respect the project's governance model:

- **Receipt Generation:** Any new adapter or tool integration must generate signed receipts for all actions.
- **Policy Gates:** New features that involve external API calls or resource consumption must integrate with the existing policy gate system.
- **Mode Governance:** Respect the `READ_ONLY`, `SINGLE_RUN_APPROVED`, and `FROZEN` mode constraints.
- **AGENTS.md Constitution:** All agent behavior must comply with the fail-closed constitution defined in `AGENTS.md`.

If you are unsure whether your contribution meets these requirements, please open an issue or ask in the community Discord before submitting a PR.
