# Contributing to SintraPrime

Thanks for helping improve SintraPrime. This repo is governed by “truth-lock” habits: changes should be reproducible, CI-shaped, and scoped.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs slice-pure (no drive-bys).
- Include “receipts” in the PR description (copy-runnable commands + exit codes).
- If your PR touches runtime-adjacent paths (e.g. `src/`, `scripts/`, `make/`, `notion/`), include a wiring scope doc when required by workflow.

## Troubleshooting

- PR checkout / local verification:
  - See: `docs/workflows/pr-checkout-troubleshooting.md`
