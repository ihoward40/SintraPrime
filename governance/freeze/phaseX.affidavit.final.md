# AFFIDAVIT OF GOVERNANCE FREEZE AND INTEGRITY
**State of ____________ )**  
**County of __________ )**

I, **Isiah Tarik Howard**, being duly sworn, declare under penalty of perjury as follows:

1. **Identity and capacity.** I am the lawful custodian and operator of a governed automation and record-keeping system used to generate and preserve administrative and evidentiary materials.

2. **Purpose.** This affidavit is offered solely to establish the **authenticity, integrity, and time-of-existence** of the referenced digital materials. It does not assert legal conclusions regarding the merits of any underlying dispute.

3. **Authoritative freeze.** An authoritative governance freeze ("**Phase X**") was completed and committed to the repository. The lock file is **phaseX.lock.json**.

4. **Lock commit and frozen source commit.**
   - The lock file **phaseX.lock.json** is committed at:  
     **ada828b2a4085ec084eb9900aff56d60042fa997**
   - The lock captures the frozen pre-lock commit:  
     **6bc5743b847a26559c62396778a30b4251b010e3**, and records **tree_clean = true**.

5. **Integrity values (SHA-256).**
   - **Lock file path:** governance/freeze/phaseX.lock.json
   - **Lock file SHA-256:**  
     **e243211e901dd210a2e01a82ab07e3e4be8b9890cb52e160ce24320bc4f1c252**
   - **Phase X root hash (from committed lock):**  
     **34252399507137d80824a2d02ce83fe42a3318fb06b48d1546f04f202b083f7a**
   - **Deterministic bundle filename:** ike-governance-phaseX.zip  
   - **Bundle SHA-256:**  
     **8b94fb2456b4549ab8de76d0438e9853e889e65e7e7a441004c0fda3d35a1d2b**

6. **Independent verification.** The lock file records a deterministic inventory of governed materials and their hashes, permitting any third party to verify that (a) they possess the same bundle and (b) the governed materials have not changed since the freeze, by comparing SHA-256 values.

7. **RFC-3161 TSA statement (no TSA evidence attached).** No RFC-3161 timestamp response (.tsr) is attached to this affidavit. This affidavit makes no claim of third-party timestamping. The integrity claims in this affidavit rely on deterministic hashing, the committed lock, and repository provenance.
