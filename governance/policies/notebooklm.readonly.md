# NotebookLM Read-Only Analysis Policy

## Purpose
NotebookLM may be used solely to summarize, cross-reference, and answer questions about **frozen, read-only artifacts** generated by the system.

## Scope
NotebookLM outputs are analytical aids only. They do not create, modify, execute, or validate records and do not alter verification tiers, manifests, or freeze boundaries.

## Source Restrictions
Only post-freeze, public-safe artifacts may be provided to NotebookLM. Pre-freeze inputs, private logs, keys, credentials, or execution controls are prohibited.

## Non-Evidentiary Status
NotebookLM outputs are not evidence and are not submitted as exhibits. Any use is supplemental and advisory.

## Immutability
NotebookLM outputs must not be referenced by execution paths, snapshot builders, exhibit generators, or tier detection logic.

## Disclosure
When referenced, the following disclosure applies:

> Supplemental analytical summaries may be generated using third-party language models operating solely over frozen, read-only records, in accordance with governance policy `notebooklm.readonly.md`. Such summaries are not evidence and do not modify the underlying artifacts.
