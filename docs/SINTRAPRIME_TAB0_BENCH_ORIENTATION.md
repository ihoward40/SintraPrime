# TAB 0 — BENCH-FRIENDLY ORIENTATION (FOR THE COURT)

Use only if the Court addresses you directly. Read verbatim.

“Your Honor, before addressing substance, I’d like to orient the Court to Tab 0 of the binder.
Tab 0A is a one-page examiner summary explaining the process under which the materials were generated.
Tab 0B provides the evidentiary foundation that applies to the remaining tabs.
I’m prepared to proceed to substance at the Court’s direction.”

Stop after delivering this. Hands down. No filler.

Why this works:
- Signals respect for the Court’s time
- Frames Tab 0 as orientation, not advocacy
- Invites direction instead of pushing argument
