# Notion Template Spec (Pointer)

The Notion database schema and template export spec is treated as a *contract*.

This repo enforces Make/Slack governance first (auto-lint). With enforcement locked, the Notion import artifacts live here:

- Schemas: `notion/schemas/*.schema.json`
- Migration CSVs: `notion/migrations/*.csv`
- Button/Webhook contract: `docs/notion-button-webhook-contract.md`
- Import strategy: `docs/notion-import-strategy.md`

If you want the full narrative template export spec text added verbatim (as a human-facing systems document), say so and I’ll add it as a dedicated document.
