# JUDICIAL NOTICE OF GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK (SintraPrime Mode)

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

This notice describes the governance framework under which certain documents and analytical outputs were generated.

SintraPrime Mode is a procedural governance framework that requires advance declaration of mode status, scope, authority basis, and execution constraints before any analytical or document-generation activity may occur.

Under SintraPrime Mode:
- Execution is prohibited unless all required declarations are present.
- The sole authority basis permitted is documentary evidence.
- Speculative inference and undeclared assumptions are disallowed.
- Failure to satisfy governance conditions results in automatic procedural refusal.

Each output generated under SintraPrime Mode includes a visible mode declaration and is capable of independent review based on the declared scope and referenced evidence.

This notice is informational in nature and is not offered as argument, legal opinion, or advocacy.

Respectfully submitted,
