# Governance Tag Status Register

This register records the status and intended citation scope of governance-related tags.
Tags are immutable historical anchors and do not, by themselves, grant authority,
trigger execution, or alter system behavior.

Dates in this register reflect external citation or filing usage, not internal
development activity.

## Retirement Notes

When a governance tag is superseded, it will be marked as “Retired (Superseded)”
in this register. Retirement does not invalidate the tag; it limits its use to
historical, time-specific reference.
