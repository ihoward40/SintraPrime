# Governance Tag Status Register

This register records the status and intended citation scope of governance-related tags.
Tags are immutable historical anchors and do not, by themselves, grant authority,
trigger execution, or alter system behavior.

## Retirement Notes

When a governance tag is superseded, it will be marked as “Retired (Superseded)”
in this register. Retirement does not invalidate the tag; it limits its use to
historical, time-specific reference.
