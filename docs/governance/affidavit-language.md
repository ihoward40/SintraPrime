# Affidavit Language — System Posture

The following paragraph is provided for sworn statements or declarations.

---

At system startup, SintraPrime operates locally on my computer in a read-only,
offline configuration. In this posture, the system is technically incapable of
transmitting data, executing automated tasks, or modifying evidence.

Any action that produces output requires a deliberate, manual authorization
created by me for a single, specific execution. That authorization expires
automatically, permits only one execution, and is recorded in an append-only
ledger with a timestamp and cryptographic hash.

After execution, the system immediately returns to its read-only, offline state.
No automated process may initiate actions independently or retain persistent
permission to act.

This language describes the system’s actual operating constraints.
