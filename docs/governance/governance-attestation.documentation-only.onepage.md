## Attestation

I hereby attest as follows:

1. **Documentation-Only Governance.**  
   The governance materials for the referenced system are maintained solely as documentation and navigational records. They are non-executable, do not initiate system actions, do not grant authority, and do not alter runtime behavior.

2. **Read-Only Governance Index.**  
   The governance materials are organized through a read-only navigational index located at `docs/governance/README.md`, fixed at commit **6ec2239ea5fa4ed6f2c165d44c2c9eedfd0096e8** and identified by the lightweight tag **governance-index-v1**. This index serves only to reference documentation-only materials for transparency, review, and audit purposes.

3. **Intent Declaration and Review Discipline.**  
   Any future proposal to connect governance documentation to execution paths requires an explicit wiring-scope declaration, review-time disclosure, and human approval in accordance with documented review guardrails. No such wiring is implied by the existence of the governance materials themselves.

4. **Tag Usage and Retirement.**  
   Governance-related tags are immutable historical anchors used solely to identify the state of documentation or navigational materials as of a specific time. When a tag is later marked as retired or superseded, such designation does not invalidate the tagged materials and limits their citation to historical or time-specific reference only. No retired tag is asserted to represent current authority, operational status, or system behavior.

5. **Dates and External Citation.**  
   Any dates associated with governance tags reflect external citation or filing usage, not internal development activity. Where dates are marked “TBD,” no external filing or citation has occurred as of the time of submission.

6. **Scope of Attestation.**  
   This attestation is limited to governance documentation, indexing, tagging, and review discipline. It makes no representations regarding system performance, correctness, legality, or operational outcomes.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
