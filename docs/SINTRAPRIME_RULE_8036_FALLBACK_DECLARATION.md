# DECLARATION OF BUSINESS RECORDS (Rule 803(6) Fallback) — SintraPrime Mode

I, ______________________, declare as follows:

1. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to make this declaration.
2. I am familiar with the record-keeping practices and governance controls associated with the SintraPrime Mode framework.

3. Records generated under SintraPrime Mode are created at or near the time of the events or processes they describe by, or from information transmitted by, persons or systems with knowledge of those events or processes.
4. Such records are kept in the course of regularly conducted activity.
5. Making these records is a regular practice of that activity.

6. SintraPrime Mode requires advance declaration of mode status, scope, authority basis, and execution constraints. Automated controls prevent execution unless all required declarations are present and valid; if conditions are unmet, execution is halted and a procedural refusal record may be generated.
7. The sole authority basis permitted is documentary evidence; speculative inference and undeclared assumptions are prohibited.

8. Records are maintained consistently and preserved as part of regular operations to support traceability, consistency, and independent review.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
