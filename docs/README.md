# Governance Documentation (Specifications Only)

This directory contains **documentation, schemas, and templates only**.

The materials in this folder are:
- Non-executable
- Not wired into runtime behavior
- Not referenced by CI or enforcement paths
- Intended for drafting, review, filing, and future implementation planning

Nothing in this directory:
- Grants authority
- Triggers execution
- Alters system behavior
- Implies activation or endorsement

Any future wiring of these specifications into execution paths must occur
in a separate feature branch with explicit review and approval.

This separation is intentional and preserves audit clarity.
