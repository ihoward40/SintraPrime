# Audit & Integrity Statements (By Audience)

These variants preserve the same factual posture as the baseline statement.
Only tone and emphasis change.

## Bank / Financial Institution Tone

> **Audit & Control Integrity Statement (Banking Context).**
> The system employs a layered control architecture that exceeds conventional audit logging by separating governance, execution, observation, and verification into distinct, non-overlapping functions. All executable actions occur only after explicit validation and produce run-scoped records. Optional observational artifacts, such as interface recordings, are strictly non-authoritative and never required for approval or completion. Integrity of finalized records is ensured through append-only SHA-256 hash chains, independently verifiable offline using a deterministic tool with no execution capability. Governance rules are versioned, immutable, and may be amended only through explicit releases. This design prevents silent control expansion, supports independent verification, and aligns with internal-control and auditability expectations in regulated financial environments.

## Platform / Technology Company Tone

> **System Transparency & Integrity Statement (Platform Context).**
> The system is designed with explicit separation between governance, execution, observation, and verification to prevent hidden automation or unintended authority escalation. Execution occurs only following validation and produces isolated, run-specific artifacts. Observational features, such as optional interface recordings, are opt-in and informational only; they do not initiate, approve, or modify actions. Artifact integrity is protected via append-only cryptographic hash chains that can be verified offline without relying on the system itself. Governance behavior is versioned and immutable unless explicitly updated. This architecture enables transparent review, discourages misuse, and supports platform trust and safety requirements without exposing internal reasoning or credentials.

## Court / Judicial Tone

> **Record Integrity & Governance Statement (Judicial Context).**
> The system maintains a structured recordkeeping model that separates governance authority, execution, observation, and verification. Actions are executed only after validation and generate discrete, run-specific records. Any observational materials, including interface recordings or screenshots, are optional, non-authoritative, and produced solely as contextual witnesses. Finalized records are protected using append-only SHA-256 hash chains, allowing independent verification that artifacts were not altered after creation. Governance rules are fixed by versioned release and cannot change without explicit declaration. This structure preserves chain-of-custody principles, prevents retroactive modification, and enables independent verification without reliance on system discretion.
