2. I am familiar with the record-keeping practices and governance controls associated with the SintraPrime Mode framework.

Records Description
3. Records generated under SintraPrime Mode consist of documents, logs, and analytical outputs produced in the ordinary course of operations using standardized procedures.

Governance Controls

6. Automated controls prevent execution unless all required declarations are present and valid.
7. If governance conditions are not satisfied, execution is halted and a procedural refusal record may be generated.

Evidence Basis
8. The sole authority basis permitted for SintraPrime Mode records is documentary evidence.
9. Speculative inference and undeclared assumptions are not permitted within the framework.

Integrity & Maintenance
10. Records are maintained in a consistent manner and preserved as part of regular operations.
11. The governance framework is designed to support traceability, consistency, and independent review.
