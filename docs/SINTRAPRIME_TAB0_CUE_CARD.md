# TAB 0 — ON-THE-RECORD CUE CARD (SintraPrime Binder)

## WHEN TO OFFER TAB 0
- At first reference to the binder
- When authenticity or foundation is raised
- Before any substantive discussion of later tabs
Do not wait to be challenged; offer as orientation.

## ONE-SENTENCE OFFER (VERBATIM)
“Before addressing substance, I’m offering Tab 0, which explains the governance framework under which the remaining materials were generated and provides the evidentiary foundation applicable to the rest of the binder.”

## IF ASKED “WHAT IS THIS?” (VERBATIM)
“Tab 0A is an examiner summary describing the process, and Tab 0B is a business-records declaration establishing authenticity and regular practice for the remaining tabs.”

## IF AUTHENTICITY IS QUESTIONED
“The authenticity foundation is addressed in Tab 0B, which applies to subsequent tabs.”

## IF SCOPE OR METHOD IS QUESTIONED
“The scope and execution constraints are described in Tab 0A.”

## IF SOMEONE ASKS “IS THIS AI?”
“It’s a governed process. Tab 0 explains the constraints.”

## WHAT NOT TO ARGUE (EVER)
- How smart the system is
- Why it is better than alternatives
- Whether someone should trust it
- Anything about intent, motive, or fairness

## IF INTERRUPTED OR TALKED OVER
“Tab 0 addresses that point.” (Repeat once if necessary, then stop.)

## IF PRESSED TO EXPLAIN FURTHER
“The binder is structured so Tab 0 answers foundational questions before the substantive tabs.”

## IF A STIPULATION IS REQUESTED
“A stipulated authenticity notice is included in the materials for pre-hearing consideration.” Do not negotiate orally.

## EXIT LINE (USE ONLY IF NEEDED)
“I’m happy to proceed tab by tab, starting after Tab 0.”

## REMEMBER
Tab 0 is orientation and foundation, not argument.
If you argue, you dilute it. If you explain, you invite debate. If you point and stop, you control the frame.
