# SINTRAPRIME COURT DAY PRINT CHECKLIST

## A. Binder Assembly (Primary Copy)
☐ Binder is clean, no handwriting, no loose pages
☐ All pages are single-sided (unless court allows double-sided)
☐ Page numbers are present and consistent
☐ No sticky notes, flags only on tab edges if used

Required Front Order (Top to Bottom)
1. Cover Page (if used)
2. Bench Memo (Orientation Only)
3. Tab 0A — Examiner Summary
4. Tab 0B — Rule 902 Declaration
5. Tab 0 Divider Page
6. Tab 1 onward — Substantive materials

☐ Divider pages are thicker cardstock
☐ Tabs are labeled per the tab label spec (ALL CAPS, bold)

## B. Copies (Minimum Set)
☐ Court copy (complete binder)
☐ Opposing party copy (complete binder)
☐ Your working copy (complete binder)

Recommended extra
☐ One spare Tab 0 packet (Tab 0A + 0B + Divider) loose

## C. Physical Quality Check (Do This Once)
☐ Pages turn easily (not overstuffed)
☐ Tabs visible when binder is closed
☐ Divider pages do not curl
☐ No missing or duplicated pages

If anything feels sloppy, fix it. Courts notice.

## D. On-Record Materials (Carry Separately)
☐ Tab 0 Cue Card (verbatim)
☐ Wallet-size 5-line card (optional)
☐ One-line docket description

Keep these out of the binder.

## E. Day-Of Conduct (This Matters)
☐ Speak only when recognized
☐ Do not explain unless asked
☐ Point to tabs, do not summarize them
☐ If interrupted, stop immediately

If confused, say nothing until directed.

## F. End-of-Day Preservation
☐ Reassemble binder exactly as filed
☐ Do not annotate
☐ Store as "filed copy"

That binder is now part of history.
