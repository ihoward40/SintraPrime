# SintraPrime Mode — Governance & Execution Overview

## What Is SintraPrime Mode?
SintraPrime Mode is a governance framework that forces advance declaration of scope, authority, and execution limits before any output is produced. No declaration, no action.

## Why It Exists
- Prevent undeclared assumptions
- Eliminate post-hoc reasoning
- Tie outputs to documented evidence
- Enable auditability and third-party review

## How SintraPrime Mode Works
Before any action:
- A **Mode Status** is declared
- A **Scope** is declared
- An **Authority Basis** is declared
- Execution is locked to that declaration

If any requirement is missing, execution is halted automatically.

## Mode Status Definitions
- **ACTIVE** — Analysis and document generation permitted within declared scope
- **OBSERVE ONLY** — Review and logging only; no generation or enforcement
- **REFUSAL ISSUED** — Formal refusal due to insufficient authority, evidence, or scope
- **AUDIT RESPONSE** — Outputs limited to clarifications, evidence presentation, audit replies

## Authority Basis
All SintraPrime outputs operate under a single authority basis:
**Documentary Evidence Only**
No speculative reasoning, inference, or unstated assumptions are permitted.

## Auditability
Every SintraPrime run includes:
- Visible mode declaration
- Locked scope statement
- Linked evidence sources
- Unique run identifier
- Automation provenance (where applicable)

This allows independent review without relying on internal explanations.

## Summary
SintraPrime Mode is not a cosmetic label. It is a governance constraint that makes analytical outputs predictable, reviewable, and accountable.

## Closing
For questions about methodology or review procedures, refer only to the declared scope and attached evidence.
