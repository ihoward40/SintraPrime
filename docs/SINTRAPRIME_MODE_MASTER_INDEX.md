## Key Principles

### 1. Consistency Is Enforcement

Agent Mode is powerful because:
- Same icon everywhere
- Same signal always
- Same mental shift every time

SintraPrime Mode uses the same principle. **Every integration point matters.**

### 2. Mode Declaration is Ritual

When someone sees:
```
🜂 SINTRAPRIME MODE — ACTIVE
Governance: Locked · Scope: Declared · Execution: Constrained
Authority Basis: Documentary Evidence Only
```

They understand instantly: "This is governed. This is auditable. This is official."

That's not marketing. That's enforcement.

### 3. Visual Identity is Sovereignty

You don't need OpenAI permission to make SintraPrime feel like a mode.

You need:
- A sigil (✓ you have it)
- Consistent declaration (✓ you have it)
- Integration everywhere (✓ checklist mapped)

### 4. Every Detail Matters

The sigil color (#D4AF8C, not #2563eb):
- Feels aged, institutional, official
- Not startup-friendly
- Reads "government binder" not "hip app"

The Mode Declaration wording:
- "Governance: Locked" — hard constraint
- "Execution: Constrained" — action limited
- "Authority Basis" — why this is legitimate

These aren't fluff. They're signals.

## What Success Looks Like

When SintraPrime Mode is live:

**Week 1:**
- People see the icon in ChatGPT sidebar
- They recognize it (because it's consistent)
- They click it knowing they're in "governed thinking" mode

**Week 2:**
- Desktop shortcut becomes muscle memory
- People stop mixing SintraPrime with casual chat
- Notarized outputs start appearing with Mode Declaration headers

**Week 3:**
- Auditors see the icon + header
- They understand the governance immediately
- They know to check OPERATOR_LEDGER

**Week 4:**
- Teams reference "SintraPrime Mode" in conversation
- It feels native, not bolted-on
- Regulators recognize the sigil

That's when you know it worked.

---

## If You Change Your Mind

Everything is in the repo, auditable, and version-controlled:

- Edit `artifacts/sintraprime-icon.svg`
- Regenerate PNGs
- Update all instances (they'll auto-pull from `artifacts/`)
- Commit the change

Changes are auditable. That's the point.

---

## Next Step: Execute

Pick your path above and start with the checklist.

You have:
1. ✓ Icon (governance-grade sigil)
2. ✓ Declarations (canonical, 5 variants)
3. ✓ Specs (exact design brief)
4. ✓ Workflow (integration mapped)
5. ✓ Checklist (60-minute deployment)

Everything you need. No fluff. No guessing.

**Go deploy SintraPrime Mode.**
