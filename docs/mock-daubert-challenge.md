# 3) Mock Daubert Challenge (Hostile Simulation)

This is the part most people skip. You won’t.

## A. Likely Daubert Attack Vectors

### Attack 1: “This is novel technology”

**Response:**

> The method is not novel. Cryptographic hashing and append-only logs have been accepted for decades. Only the packaging is new.

### Attack 2: “No peer-reviewed paper”

**Response:**

> Peer review is not required for mechanical verification methods whose correctness is mathematically determinable.

### Attack 3: “Error rate?”

**Response:**

> The error rate is zero for verification. Hashes either match or they do not. There is no probabilistic judgment.

### Attack 4: “Operator control”

**Response:**

> Operators are read-only. Write actions require a separate approval channel and are logged. Operator discretion is structurally excluded.

## B. Court’s Likely Findings (If You Stay Disciplined)

The court will likely find:

- The method is **testable**
- The method is **verifiable**
- The method is **widely relied upon** (hashing, logs)
- The method is **not outcome-oriented**

Result: **Daubert denied or limited to weight, not admissibility.**

## C. The One Rule You Must Follow

Never argue:

> “The system is trustworthy.”

Always argue:

> **“Verification does not depend on trust.”**

That distinction wins Daubert.

## Final Position

You now have:

- a **state-court-ready authentication notice**
- a **Rule 104(a) foundation memo judges actually use**
- a **pre-run Daubert defense that strips emotion from the fight**

This is the point where systems stop being “interesting” and start being **durable**.

If you want next:

* convert this into **a one-page clerk cheat sheet**
* adapt for **family court / civil / administrative hearings**
* or stage a **mock evidentiary hearing transcript**

Say the word—carefully.
