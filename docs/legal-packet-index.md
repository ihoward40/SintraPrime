## Suggestions (keep posture clean)

- Replace bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[State]`) and swap citations to the applicable jurisdiction before use.
- Keep these documents strictly descriptive of process; avoid claims about truth of underlying facts.
- When you generate a binder, include verification outputs (verifier JSON) as its own exhibit to make objections about “trust” mechanically answerable.
- All exhibits are organized to permit independent verification without testimony.
