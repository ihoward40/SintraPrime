# 1) State-Court Analog to FRE 902(13)/(14)

Because states vary, this is written in **neutral, transplantable form** that tracks the **Uniform Rules of Evidence** and the majority of state evidence codes (including NJ, NY, PA, CA analogs).

You will later swap the rule citations to the exact state numbers.

## **NOTICE OF INTENT TO OFFER CERTIFIED ELECTRONIC RECORDS

(STATE EVIDENCE CODE ANALOG)**

**Body (verbatim-ready):**

> PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the undersigned intends to offer electronically stored information (“ESI”) as **self-authenticating electronic records** pursuant to the applicable provisions of the [State] Rules of Evidence governing:
>
> • authentication of electronic records,
> • records generated by automated systems, and
> • certified records of regularly conducted activity.
>
> The evidence consists of **machine-generated records** produced automatically by a computerized evidence system in the ordinary course of its operation, including:
>
> • execution manifests
> • append-only event ledgers
> • cryptographic hash records
> • independent verification outputs
>
> Authentication will be established by a **sworn certification of the records custodian** (Exhibit 0), attesting that:
>
> 1. The records were generated automatically by a reliable electronic process;
> 2. The system produces records contemporaneously with the events recorded;
> 3. The records are stored in a manner that prevents undetected alteration; and
> 4. The integrity of the records can be independently verified through cryptographic hash comparison.
>
> Verification artifacts enabling independent confirmation are included as **Exhibit B**.
>
> Because the records are self-authenticating under the applicable state evidence rules, **no live foundational testimony is required** unless the Court orders otherwise.
