# Cross-Examination Defense Script (Bench-Ready)

Use this exactly as written. Short answers. No volunteering.

## A. “You created this evidence yourself, correct?”

> **Correct. The system generated the records automatically. I did not edit them.**

---

## B. “So we’re supposed to trust your system?”

> **No. Verification does not require trust. The hashes either match or they do not.**

---

## C. “Couldn’t you change the files before court?”

> **Any change would invalidate the verification. Exhibit B demonstrates the files are unaltered.**

---

## D. “What about the screen recordings?”

> **They are non-authoritative illustrations. The authoritative evidence is the hashed records.**

---

## E. “You control the operator account, right?”

> **Operators are read-only. Write actions require a separate approval process and environmental confirmation.**

---

## F. “This is very technical, isn’t it?”

> **The court does not need to understand the system—only that verification passes or fails.**

Stop there. Do **not** elaborate.
