# External Notes — ChatGPT Share 69629d4b-840c-8011-bc18-c5a0a5d80618 (v1)

## Purpose
This document records a **non-authoritative** external conversation reference and maps any mentioned capabilities to **repo reality**.

This exists to prevent implied-capability drift.

## Non-Authoritative Disclaimer (Mandatory)
This page summarizes external discussion. It does **not** define system behavior.

Authoritative behavior is defined only by:
- versioned, tagged repository artifacts, and
- implemented code paths in this repository.

## Source

## Retrieval Note
The shared page content is presented as a web view and may be truncated or incomplete.
This document only maps claims that were **visible at retrieval time**.

## Visible Topics (High Level)
From the visible portion of the share page, the conversation discusses:
- “Deepthink” runner integration concepts
- CI “gates” for deepthink
- Make.com scenario imports (Build/DR/Lint suite)
- “TPM-backed signing” / “attestation” as a Tier-2 upgrade idea
- Court filing/binder formatting suggestions (docket line, exhibit binder language)

## Spec-vs-Repo Gap Map

| Item / Claim (as discussed externally) | Visible in share page | Repo status (as of 2026-01-12) | Notes / Evidence |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Deepthink runner (`deepthink.mjs`) | Yes | ❌ Not implemented / not present | No matching file found in this repo during search (`deepthink.mjs`). |
| `deepthink_request.json` | Yes | ❌ Not implemented / not present | Not found during search. |
| `npm run ci:deepthink-gates` | Yes | ❌ Not implemented / not present | No matching script name found. |
| `build_snapshot.ps1` | Yes | ❌ Not implemented / not present | Not found during search. |
| TPM-backed signing / “signing.mjs” layer | Yes | ❌ Not implemented / not present | No `signing.mjs` found; TPM signing not claimed as implemented. |
| “Tier 2” (TPM attestation) is live | Implied | ❌ Not claimed / not implemented | Treat as aspirational unless implemented and explicitly documented. |
| Court binder / exhibit packaging tooling | Conceptually aligned | ✅ Implemented (separate feature set) | See scripts such as scripts/make-court-binder.ts and scripts/make-court-packet.ts. |

## Claims Boundary
This gap map asserts only:
- whether specific files/scripts were found in this repository at the time of review, and
- whether the repo contains related implemented tooling.

It does not assert:
- correctness of any external advice,
- any operational deployment status,
- legal sufficiency,
- or that planned work will be implemented.

## Handling Rule
External discussions MAY be archived here as non-authoritative notes.
They MUST NOT be treated as governing specs unless converted into:
- versioned documentation in this repo, and/or
- implemented code with a clear “implemented vs not implemented” boundary.
