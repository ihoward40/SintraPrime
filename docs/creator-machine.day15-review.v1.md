# Creator Machine — Day-15 Review Ritual (Email → Revenue)

All review happens inside Notion.

Timebox: **45 minutes total**. Set a timer.

---

## Step 1 — Pull the Only View That Matters (10 min)

Create a filtered view of **CONTENT FACTORY — One Idea, Many Outputs**.

**Filters**
- `Format` = `Email`
- `Status` = `Published`
- Date window: last 14 days
  - Preferred: filter by a date property on the email row (e.g., `Published At`).
  - If you don’t have one: use `Created time` (approximation), or add a rollup date from the linked capture.

**Show these columns**
- `Content Piece` (title)
- `Revenue Attribution`
- `Associated Offer`
- `Revenue Signal`

This is your dataset. Nothing else counts.

---

## Step 2 — Sort by Revenue Signal (5 min)

Group or sort Emails by `Revenue Signal`:
- Strong
- Moderate
- Weak
- Not Observed

Ignore volume. Signal > frequency.

---

## Step 3 — Pattern Extraction (15 min)

For **Strong + Moderate only**, answer these in writing (bullets, not essays):

1) What problem was named explicitly?
2) What action did the email invite?
3) What role did you occupy?
   - Teacher
   - Guide
   - Operator
   - Peer
   - Authority

Scan for repeats.

You are hunting recurring **structures**, not topics.

---

## Conversion Lens (Use This, Not Instinct)

Do not use:
- “This email was better written.”
- “People liked this topic.”
- “Timing was good.”

Replace with:
- Clear pain → clear next step
- Specific audience → specific outcome
- Calm authority → not hype

If an email converted with less polish, that’s a signal: structure beat style.

## Amend One Rule — Only If Evidence Demands It

Optional. Not mandatory.

### Amendment Test (all must be true)
A rule may be amended only if:
1) The same pattern appears at least **3** times
2) It produced measurable revenue signal
3) The change simplifies execution (never complicates)

If any fail → no amendment.

### Illustrative examples
- If emails that ask a question convert more → add a sub-rule inside Email Quality (don’t add a new checklist).
- If service inquiries outperform product links → amend the revenue default, not the content formats.
- If shorter emails outperform longer ones → add a length guideline, not a new workflow.

You are tuning, not rebuilding.

---

## If You Amend (Required Protocol)

1) Update **Amendment Log** in `docs/creator-machine.v1.md`
2) Log:
   - Date
   - Evidence summary (1–2 lines)
   - Exact rule change
3) Bump version to **v1.1**
4) Freeze again for 14 days

No silent edits. Ever.

---

## If No Pattern Emerges

Not failure.

It means:
- You executed cleanly
- Your sample size is still forming
- The machine worked as intended

Operators extend the run. They don’t panic-pivot.
