# Hash Integrity Notice (v1)

> **Hash Integrity Notice.**
> Certain run artifacts may be accompanied by SHA-256 hash entries recorded in an append-only ledger for integrity verification. These hashes are computed only after the referenced artifacts are finalized and are chained sequentially within the run. Hash entries are observational and do not confer execution authority, approval, or legal effect. The absence of hash entries does not invalidate a run, and the presence of hash entries does not substitute for independent review. Hashing is provided solely to enable third-party verification that recorded artifacts were not altered after capture.
