# Verifier Index (v1.0.0)

- [Independent re-verification procedure (read-only)](./independent_reverification_procedure.readonly.v1.0.0.md) — Use when you need a minimal, offline procedure to check integrity claims without relying on any author.
- [Verification kit README](./verification_kit_README.v1.0.0.txt) — Use when you are handed a bundle and need to understand what it contains and what verification is (and is not) expected.
- [Hostile third-party re-verification simulation](./hostile_third_party_reverification_simulation.v1.0.0.md) — Use when you want to probe expected failure modes under tampering attempts and verify the system rejects altered inputs.
