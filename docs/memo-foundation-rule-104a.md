This is the memo judges actually read.

## **MEMORANDUM OF LAW

FOUNDATION FOR ADMISSION OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS
(Preliminary Question Under Rule 104(a))**

### Issue Presented

Whether the Court may find, as a preliminary matter, that the proffered electronic records are authentic and reliable without submitting foundational questions to the jury.

### Governing Standard

Under Rule 104(a), the Court—not the jury—determines preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence, including authentication and reliability.

The proponent need only show that **a reasonable fact-finder could conclude the evidence is what it purports to be**.

### Argument

**I. The Records Are Generated by an Automated, Neutral Process**

The proffered records are not narrative statements or human recollections. They are **machine-generated outputs**, created automatically by software processes without discretionary human input.

Courts routinely distinguish machine-generated records from testimonial evidence because they do not depend on memory, perception, or credibility.

**II. Reliability Is Established by Process, Not Opinion**

Reliability is demonstrated through:

* contemporaneous generation,
* append-only storage,
* cryptographic hashing, and
* independent verification capability.

No subjective expert opinion is required. Integrity is demonstrated mechanically.

**III. Independent Verification Eliminates Risk of Undetected Alteration**

The opposing party is not asked to “trust” the system. They are provided the verification tools necessary to confirm authenticity independently.

If the hashes match, the records are authentic. If they do not, the evidence fails.

**IV. The Jury Has No Role in Technical Authentication**

Authentication here is binary and mechanical. There is no credibility assessment for the jury to perform.

Accordingly, the Court may properly admit the evidence under Rule 104(a) without jury involvement.

### Conclusion

The Court should find that the proffered electronic records satisfy foundational requirements and are admissible as a matter of law.
