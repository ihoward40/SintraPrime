SintraPrime was designed from the ground up to meet this challenge with its **court-ready evidence systems**.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### What is Court-Ready Evidence?\\n\\nCourt-ready evidence must satisfy several key legal principles:\\n\\n1.  **Authenticity**: Can you prove the evidence is what it purports to be?\\n2.  **Integrity**: Can you prove the evidence has not been altered since it was created?\\n3.  **Chain of Custody**: Can you document every person and system that has handled the evidence?\\n4.  **Relevance**: Is the evidence pertinent to the matter at hand?\\n5.  **Best Evidence Rule**: When the content of a document is at issue, the original document (or a reliable copy) must be produced.\\n\\nSintraPrime\u2019s evidence lifecycle is designed to meet these standards.\\n\\n### The Evidence Lifecycle in SintraPrime\\n\\n1.  **Ingestion**: Evidence is collected from multiple sources\u2014emails, web pages, phone calls\u2014through governed adapters. The moment data enters the system, its chain of custody begins.\\n\\n2.  **Processing & Verification**: Raw data is processed into a structured format. Crucially, a **SHA-256 hash** is computed for the original content, and the entire evidence package is signed with an **Ed25519 digital signature**. This ensures both integrity and authenticity.\\n\\n3.  **Storage**: The verified evidence, along with its cryptographic hashes and signatures, is stored in a dedicated evidence locker. The associated **receipt** from the operation is permanently linked to the evidence.\\n\\n4.  **Assembly**: This is where SintraPrime\u2019s high-level evidence tools come into play:\\n    *   The **Timeline Builder** correlates events from dozens or hundreds of individual evidence items into a single, chronological narrative of what happened.\\n    *   The **Narrative Generator** uses this timeline to produce a human-readable, legal-grade summary of events, complete with citations pointing directly to the underlying evidence.\\n    *   The **Binder Assembly** system compiles everything\u2014the narrative, the timeline, the raw evidence, and the cryptographic verification reports\u2014into a single, court-ready PDF binder.\\n\\n### A Practical Example: Web Snapshots\\n\\nImagine you need to prove what a company\u2019s terms of service page said on a specific date. SintraPrime\u2019s **Web Snapshot** system handles this automatically:\\n\\n1.  It periodically captures a full, evidence-grade screenshot and PDF of the page.\\n2.  It computes a hash of the page content. If the hash changes, it flags a modification.\\n3.  The capture is timestamped, signed, and stored with a complete chain of custody.\\n\\nWhen you need to produce this in court, you don\u2019t just have a screenshot; you have a cryptographically verifiable artifact that proves what that page looked like at a precise moment in time, and that it hasn\u2019t been tampered with since.\\n\\nBy integrating these legal and forensic principles directly into the agent operating system, SintraPrime enables a new class of autonomous operations in regulated and high-stakes environments.\\n\\nExplore the full capabilities in the [**Evidence Systems documentation**](/docs/evidence-systems/lifecycle)."},{"id":"deep-dive-governance-model","metadata":{"permalink":"/SintraPrime/blog/deep-dive-governance-model","editUrl":"https://github.com/ihoward40/SintraPrime/tree/gh-pages-source/blog/2026-02-22-deep-dive-governance.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-02-22-deep-dive-governance.md","title":"Deep Dive: SintraPrime\'s Fail-Closed Governance Model","description":"One of the core design principles of SintraPrime is its fail-closed governance model.

This post explores what that means, why it\'s critical for safe AI operations, and how it\'s implemented throughout the system.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### The Problem with Fail-Open\\n\\nMost software systems, including many AI agent frameworks, operate on a \\"fail-open\\" basis. This means that if a security check fails or a policy is not explicitly defined, the system defaults to allowing the operation. While this can make development easier, it creates significant security risks. A misconfigured policy, a bug in the governance logic, or an unforeseen edge case can lead to catastrophic failures.\\n\\n### SintraPrime\'s Fail-Closed Approach\\n\\nSintraPrime takes the opposite approach. It operates on a **fail-closed** principle: **deny by default, allow only with explicit authorization.**\\n\\nThis means:\\n\\n1.  **No Ambiguity**: If a policy is not defined for a specific operation, it is denied.\\n2.  **Safety by Default**: A misconfigured or missing policy results in a safer, more restrictive system, not a more permissive one.\\n3.  **Explicit Authorization**: Every action an agent takes must be explicitly permitted by the governance layer.\\n\\n### Layers of Governance\\n\\nThis philosophy is enforced through multiple layers:\\n\\n*   **AGENTS.md Constitution**: A human-readable document that defines the fundamental rules and boundaries for all agents.\\n*   **Mode Governance**: The system operates in one of three modes (`READ_ONLY`, `SINGLE_RUN_APPROVED`, `FROZEN`), with `READ_ONLY` as the default. Any action that modifies state requires an explicit mode transition.\\n*   **Policy Gates**: Granular rules that control everything from spending limits to which domains the browser adapter can visit.\\n*   **Immutable Receipt Ledger**: Every decision, whether an approval or a denial, is recorded in a cryptographic receipt, creating a permanent, tamper-evident audit trail.\\n\\n### An Example: The Shell Adapter\\n\\nThe Shell adapter, which allows agents to execute system commands, is a powerful but potentially dangerous tool. Here\u2019s how fail-closed governance protects it:\\n\\n1.  **Command Whitelist**: The adapter maintains a strict whitelist of allowed commands (e.g., `ls`, `cat`, `grep`). If an agent tries to run a command not on this list (e.g., `rm`), the operation is denied instantly.\\n2.  **Mode Check**: Even if the command is on the whitelist, the system\'s governance mode must be `SINGLE_RUN_APPROVED`. If it\'s in `READ_ONLY` mode, the request is denied.\\n3.  **Receipt Generation**: The denial is recorded in a receipt, including which policy failed and why. This allows operators to audit not just what happened, but what was *prevented* from happening.\\n\\nBy building on a foundation of fail-closed governance, SintraPrime provides the guarantees necessary for deploying autonomous AI agents in high-stakes, production environments. It shifts the security posture from \\"allow unless forbidden\\" to \\"deny unless explicitly permitted,\\" a critical step forward for building trustworthy AI.\\n\\nRead more in the [**Governance Model documentation**](/docs/core-concepts/governance-model)."},{"id":"announcing-sintraprime","metadata":{"permalink":"/SintraPrime/blog/announcing-sintraprime","editUrl":"https://github.com/ihoward40/SintraPrime/tree/gh-pages-source/blog/2026-02-20-announcing-sintraprime.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-02-20-announcing-sintraprime.md","title":"Announcing SintraPrime v2.0 \u2014 The Governance OS for AI Agents","description":"Today, I am thrilled to announce the release of SintraPrime v2.0, a multi-branch governance operating system for AI agents.
