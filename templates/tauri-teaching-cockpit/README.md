# Tauri Teaching Cockpit (Paste-Ready Template)

This folder is a **paste-ready** scaffold for a Tauri frontend.

- It is **overlay-only**: vocabulary + examples only.
- It makes **zero logic changes** to CIN.
- It is **not wired** into this repo’s running web UI.

Operator ledger (Sweep 2):
- Frontend helper: `src/state/operatorLog.ts`
- Tauri commands: `src-tauri/src/commands/operator_log.rs`

Copy `templates/tauri-teaching-cockpit/src/` into your Tauri frontend `src/` and integrate routing as needed.
