# SintraPrime Court Verification Kit

This directory defines the structure for an offline, read-only verification kit
intended for court, audit, or regulatory review.

No executable agents, background services, or network-enabled tools belong here.

---

## Purpose

The court kit is designed to verify:

- Evidence bundle integrity
- Manifest correctness
- Cryptographic signatures (where applicable)
- Ledger invariants

All verification is performed offline.

├─ VERIFY/
│  ├─ pubkey.pem

├─ BUNDLES/
│  └─ (sealed evidence bundles)
└─ REPORTS/
└─ (verification outputs)

```

## VERIFY/

Contains materials required to verify authenticity:

- Public verification key(s)
- Verifier documentation or binaries
- No private keys

Nothing in this directory should modify bundles.

---

## BUNDLES/

Contains sealed evidence bundles.

Rules:
- Bundles are read-only
- Bundles are not extracted in place
- Bundles are never modified

---

## REPORTS/

Contains outputs generated by verification:

- Hash reports
- Signature verification results
- Ledger verification transcripts

Reports are written outside the bundles to preserve integrity.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

This kit must not contain:

- Agents
- Dashboards
- Network credentials
- Automation scripts
- Private keys

---

## Interpretation

This directory represents a verification boundary.
Everything inside is either evidence, verification material, or verification output.

No authority exists here—only proof.
