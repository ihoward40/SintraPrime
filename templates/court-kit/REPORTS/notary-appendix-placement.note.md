# Appendix Placement Note (Door 2 — Notarized Transcript Hashing)

Placement (recommended):

- Keep the normal transcript packet order unchanged.
- Insert the two Door 2 pages immediately before the notary page set:
  1) “Hash Declaration (Exhibit Page)”
  2) “Notary Acknowledgment (New Jersey — Acknowledgment)”

In this repo, those pages are already included in the verification transcript template:

- `templates/court-kit/REPORTS/verification-transcript.template.md`

No changes are required to CIN, the verifier, or the operator ledger.
