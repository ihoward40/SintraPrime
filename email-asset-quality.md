# Email Asset Quality — Pass/Fail Checklist

An email asset is considered **Valid** only if all five are true:

1. **Single Core Idea**
   One idea, one promise. No topic blending.

2. **Clear Reader Outcome**
   The reader knows what they gain by the end (clarity, decision, next step).

3. **Concrete Insight or Action**
   At least one specific takeaway or action—not motivation, not vibes.

4. **Plain-Language Persuasion**
   Written as a human speaking to one person. No corporate tone, no fluff.

5. **Soft Revenue Bridge Present**
   Mentions a related service, product, or next step *without pitching hard*.

If any item fails → status stays **Draft**.
